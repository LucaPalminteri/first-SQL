### What's the goal of this project?

I'm just doing some **SQL** skills practice, I'll try to do a simple frontend page with some buttons that will request some information to the backend.
The backend is the core of this repo, I'll do one file that handles the front request made in JavaScript or TypeScript and then another files that
will connect to my local server **(XAMPP - Apache - MySql)** and using Node.js I'll create simple API REST architecture.
